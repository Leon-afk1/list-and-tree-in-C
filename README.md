# C Data Structures Example

A simple C project demonstrating the use of linked lists and trees with various functions.

## Introduction

This project serves as an example of using linked lists and trees in C. It provides a set of functions for manipulating these data structures, offering flexibility and ease of use. The primary goal is to showcase common operations on lists and trees, making it a handy reference for those interested in C programming.

## Features

- **Linked Lists:**
  - Insertion at the head and tail.
  - Removal from the head and tail.
  - Counting elements.
  - Sorting and reversing.
  - Checking if the list is sorted.

- **Trees:**
  - Creation of a basic binary tree.
  - Tree traversal and printing.
  - Joining two trees.
  - Counting nodes and leaves.
  - Checking if a value exists in the tree.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Leon-afk1/list-and-tree-in-C.git

2. **Compile the code:**

   ```bash
    gcc main.c Biblio.c -o myprogram
   
3. **Run the executable:**

   ```bash
   ./myprogram

4. **Follow the  on-screen instruction (in french) to interact with the program.**

## Future Improvements

This project was created as an early exploration into data structures in C. Future improvements could include:

- Optimization of sorting algorithms.
- Additional tree manipulation functions.
- Enhanced user interface and error handling.
- Unit testing for functions.
